        Coffee drinking in the morning and tea at night. Churning out codes lazily while trying to maintain sanity while working on side projects (including this one) which facinates me. Tireless mind that keeps going on and on about different topics in culture, learning, development,
    and many more. This is where I start up my VSCODE to type, commit, and push all my written works while trying to draw inspiration, and also as a part of a self authoring journey for self discover, improvement, and a little dash of fun
